# RuneLaunch - ETHGlobal Brussels
RuneLaunch is a decentralized platform built on the Rootstock network, facilitating the initial launch and decentralized exchange (DEX) offering of custom runes. Runes can be created on Bitcoin using Rootstock and bridged to Rootstock for trading on RuneLaunch. This platform utilizes smart contracts to ensure transparency and trust in rune launches, allowing creators to set fixed prices and issue ERC-721 NFTs to early investors.
