# RuneLaunch Platform
RuneLaunch is a decentralized platform that facilitates the creation, investment, and redemption of runes (tokens) through NFTs. Users can seamlessly create runes, list them on a launchpad for investment, and claim their corresponding NFTs. These NFTs can then be redeemed to obtain the actual underlying tokens or runes that users have invested in.

## Features
1. Create Runes
Seamless Token Creation: Easily create new runes with specified details such as token name, symbol, description, total tokens allocated, deadline, cost per token in rBTC, and contract address.
Token Standard Support: Supports various token standards (e.g., ERC-20, ERC-721) based on Ethereum blockchain.
2. Launchpad for Investment
Runes Listing: List created runes on the launchpad for investment by other users.
Investment Opportunities: Users can invest in listed runes using rBTC (wrapped BTC) directly from their wallets through MetaMask or other compatible wallets.
3. NFTs for Runes
NFT Generation: Automatically generate NFTs (non-fungible tokens) for each rune listed on the launchpad.
Redemption Mechanism: Each NFT represents ownership of a specific amount of runes. Holders can redeem these NFTs to claim the actual underlying tokens or runes they have invested in.
4. Seamless Interaction with MetaMask
MetaMask Integration: Connects seamlessly with MetaMask for wallet management and transaction processing.
Transaction Execution: Allows users to trigger on-chain transactions directly from their wallets to interact with runes and NFTs.
